    <string name="hello3">Press the button to enjoy one of the approx. 295,147,905,200,000,000,000 pieces of waltz. To listen to all of them you\'ll need about 561,544,720,700,000 years. As a comparison, our Universe is only 13,750,000,000 years old, which means you\'ll need about 40,000 times more time than has elapsed since the Big Bang: truly a music for the eternity!</string>
